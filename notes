similarity or distance matrix
2D space for dots for each pattern
show patterns for given parameters

multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm
pairwise distances among n objects
embed n objects into lower dimensional space

cross-correlation
try all shifts
inner product, cosine similarility

edit distance
binary difference, pitch values
euclidean distance
square differences, then add

choose min among 12 shifts
rest is 12 half steps
